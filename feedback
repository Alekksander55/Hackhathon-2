Nutrition tracker app, where user can log daily meals, track calorie intake, and monitor macronutrients.

First of all the idea of the project is really good. Its useful , practical and the ui is easy to use.
A few points to go over:
There is are controller and model folders but they seem to be empty and the whole querying to the database is done
inside the routes.
The heierarcy of these folders help maintaining cleaner and more orginised code.
I see a jwt token created but not sent to the user.
Other than that the login and register seem to be working well!
Unfortunatly a video was not provided so I coulden't see the hackathon in action- 
I would love to see it working live !
Really good job its fantastic to see your progress in the bootcamp!!!!
